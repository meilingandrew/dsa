A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices, and connections between those does, called edges. Graphs fall into different categories. `Weighed` vs `Unweighted` and `Directed` vs `Undirected`.

__Weighted:__ In a weighted graph each `edge` has a value. Normally a default of `1` is assigned. 
__Directed:__ In a directed graph the order of the two vertices matters. For example if an edge has a connection from node A to B it's does not also mean the vertices are connected from B to A.
